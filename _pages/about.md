He is also a Researcher at Shenzhen Research Institute and Chengdu Research Institute (PhD supervisor). His primary research focuses on energy economics. In his ultimate pursuit of regional sustainable development, his work utilizes economic methods to seek policy solutions to sustainability from interdisciplinary lenses.

Before joining the faculty of City University of Hong Kong in 2016, he was a postdoctoral researcher in the Center of Economic Research at ETH Zurich. He was also a researcher associated with the Energy Science Center, Simulation Lab, and the Competence Center for Research in Energy, Society, and Transition in Switzerland. He earned a Ph.D. in Economics from ETH Zurich, and was awarded a prize (best doctoral thesis of the year) by Swiss Association of Energy Economics for his PhD work. He gained his MSc degree in economics and management from the same university. Dr. Zhang studied in Peking University where he received a Bachelor in Mechanical Engineering and a Double Bachelor in Economics.

Zhang's research has been published in leading general-interest, top-field, and interdisciplinary journals including the European Economic Review, China Economic Review, Energy Economics, Resource and Energy Economics, The Energy Journal, Energy efficiency, and Energy Policy.
